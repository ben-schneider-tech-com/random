# **How to Host Your Resume using Github Pages**
## **Purpose**
----------
This README describes the process for making your resume into a static website using Jekyll and how to host that website using Github pages. Also, this README explains how these practical steps are related to Etter's general principles of technical writing.

## **Prerequisites**
-----------
- You must have an up-to-date resume formatted in markdown.

## **Instructions**
-----------
#### **Creating a Jekyll static website for your resume**
A static website is a good way to host resumes and documentation because it creates a centralized up-todate resource for people to reference. Instead of having to keep track of how you have distributed copies, you can just update the website. This makes maintaining changing resources like resumes and documentation easy. To create your static website do the following:
1. Install Jekyll on your system by [following these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)  
2. Open a console in the directory you want your static website project to be in
3. Run `jekyll new resume` to create your static website project

#### **Viewing your website in the browser**  
One of the advantages of using static websites is that they are fast and easy to work with locally. You can quickly see how your website looks without long and elaborate build processes. To see your website, simply do the following:
1. Navigate your console into the newly created project directory  
2. Run `jekyll serve --watch`  
3. Open the url [`http://127.0.0.1:4000`](http://127.0.0.1:4000) in a browser  

#### **Adding your resume to your Jekyll website**  
As your resume is written in a lightweight markup language like markdown, it easy easy to add your formatted resume to your static website. Jekyll can then easily turn your markdown resume into HTML for your website. Resources on how to customize your website more can be found under the *more resources* section of this README. You can add your resume to the Jekyll website as follows:
1. Copy and paste your the body of your resume into the `index.markdown` file in the main project directory under the dashed line
2. Change the layout varaible in the dashed line block from `home` to `default`
4. Write yuor contact information in the `about.markdown` file 
5. Open the `config.yml` [yaml file](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started) in the main directory
6. edit the `title` variable to be your name
7. edit the `email` variable to be your email  
8. delete the `description` variable
9. rerun `jekyll serve --watch` to see your resume at [`http://127.0.0.1:4000`](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

#### Additional customization for your website
To make your website more unique you can create custom [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) and [themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).

#### **Hosting your Jekyll website in Github Pages**
By using version-control like Git to control the source of your static website has several benefits. Git tracks changes made to documentation so you can always see how the documentation has been updated and what is new. Git also allows other member sof the projec to easily contribute to the project. All they need to do is make a pull request containing information to add to the static website. By following the steps below you can put your website into version control and host it on Github Pages.
1. [Download and install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Navigate to [create token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
2. Create the token with the *repo* permission
4. Save the token on your computer
2. Click create repository
3. Name the repository with the name *your_github_username.github.io*
4. Click `public repository`
5. Click `create repository`
8. Copy the url under the under the *quick setup* section in the newly created repository
9. open a console
10. run git clone with the first argument being copied url with your token and an @ sign prefixing the guthub.com part of the url.  
Note: your command shoud look something like:  
`git clone https://ghp_7vPZBJGcmSWN0nsCVY7fjNCsmxWc6B4IGBaQ@github.com/ben-schneider-tech-com/website.git`  
11. Copy and paste the contents of your jekyll static website project into the newly created repository directory
12. run `git add *`
13. run `git commit -m "my resume website"`
14. run `git push`
